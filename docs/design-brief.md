# NextGen Wallpaper — Website Design Brief

## 1. Project Overview

This website is a one-page, design-forward digital presence for NextGen Wallpaper, a modern wallpaper installation company serving homeowners. The goal is not to resemble a typical contractor website, but to position NextGen Wallpaper as a specialist craft brand — precise, tasteful, and contemporary.

The site will emphasize material quality, installation expertise, and visual restraint, appealing to homeowners who value design, longevity, and professionalism.

---

## 2. Project Goals

- Present NextGen Wallpaper as a premium, detail-oriented professional, not a generic service provider
- Instantly differentiate the brand from traditional wallpaper and home improvement competitors
- Build trust through visual proof of craftsmanship rather than sales-heavy language
- Provide a clear, simple path for homeowners to request a quote

**Success is defined by visitors understanding within seconds that this is a high-quality, modern service worth investing in.**

---

## 3. Target Audience

### Primary Audience:

- Homeowners (25–55)
- Design-conscious, modern tastes
- Interested in long-term quality rather than lowest price

### Audience Mindset:

- Cares about how a space feels
- Wants work done cleanly, correctly, and professionally
- Is wary of flashy marketing or contractor clichés

The website should feel calm, confident, and intentional — never pushy or loud.

---

## 4. Core Design Concept

**"Material-First Precision"**

The website treats wallpaper as a design material, not just a decorative finish. Visuals and motion emphasize texture, alignment, and craft.

The experience should feel closer to a design studio or high-end interior brand than a service marketplace.

### Key ideas:

- Wallpaper texture is the hero
- Precision is implied visually, not over-explained
- Simplicity communicates confidence

---

## 5. Visual Direction

### Color Palette

- Warm off-white / soft neutral backgrounds
- Charcoal or near-black primary text
- One restrained accent color (deep green, indigo, or clay)

This palette keeps focus on materials and avoids trends that may age quickly.

### Typography

- **Headlines:** Modern editorial serif — elegant, confident, and timeless
- **Body text:** Clean sans-serif — readable and understated

Typography will be spacious, with generous line-height and hierarchy, reinforcing a premium tone.

---

## 6. Imagery & Media Guidelines

- Macro photography of wallpaper textures and patterns
- Close-up installation details (seams, alignment, tools)
- Minimal use of wide room shots

Imagery should feel real, tactile, and honest — not staged or stock-heavy.

If motion is used, it will be slow and subtle, reinforcing material depth rather than showing off animation.

---

## 7. Motion & Interaction Philosophy

Motion is used sparingly and purposefully:

- Gentle fades and vertical movement
- Subtle parallax on textures
- Hover effects that suggest physical interaction

**No aggressive animations, scroll-jacking, or distracting effects. If motion is noticeable, it is likely too much.**

---

---

## 10. Technical Approach (High-Level)

- Built using modern web technologies for performance and reliability
- Optimized for fast load times and smooth interaction
- Fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile

**Technology will remain invisible to the user — the experience should feel effortless.**

---

## 11. Long-Term Value

This design direction is intentionally timeless. It avoids trends that date quickly and instead focuses on:

- Craft
- Material quality
- Precision

As NextGen Wallpaper grows, this website can scale with additional projects, photography, or pages without losing its identity.
